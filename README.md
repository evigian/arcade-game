## About

The Classic Arcade Game is the fourth project for the Google Frond-End Developers Nanodegree at Udacity. The purpose of this project is to practice our knowledge about Object Oriented Javascript. The starter code for the project was provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

## How to run the game

You can clone or download this project and run it by opening the index file on your browser. Alternatively, you can find the live game here: https://evigian.github.io/arcade-game-udacity/.


## How to play the game

Use the arrow keys of your keyboard in order to move the player up, down, right and left. Each time the player reaches at the top row of the board you win 50 points. Each time the player collides with a bug you lose one of your 3 lives. When all lives are lost the game is over, but don't worry, you can try again! Good luck!
